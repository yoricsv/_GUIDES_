### Git is a distributed version control system.
Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to help control the Linux kernel's development.

A Distributed Version Control System is a system keeps track of changes made to project files.

This changelog resides on your local machine and allows to easily revert to a previous version of the project if something goes wrong.

Git makes collaboration easy. Each team member maintains a full backup of the repositories on their local machine that they are working on. Then, thanks to an external server like BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in one place.

This way, different team members can copy it locally, and everyone will have a clear view of all the changes made by the whole team.

Git has many different commands you can use. The sixty [most commonly used commands][10].
